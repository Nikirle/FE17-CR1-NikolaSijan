        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>Home cooks are our heroes; it's as simple as that. Food blog is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate two days to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a rich weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without spending the whole evening shuffling dishes in and out of the oven. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Food blog  changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Food blog has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month.
